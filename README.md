>  Classification framework in machine learning (Overview)
>  Logistic Regression assumptions (multicollinearity from regression SLRM/MLRM)
>  IV & WOE (Information Value, Weight of Evidence)
>  RFE CV (Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validations)
>  Feature Reduction and model building work flow: 
    - %missing
    - NZV
    - RFE CV
    - Binning(IV, WOE)
    - Correlogram (correlation check)
    - Model 
    - VIF or condition index
    - Model Risk Ranking in Train and Validation sample
      (70:30) split)
